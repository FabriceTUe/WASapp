1. Stabilizing the app:
	- Make it so that the UI constantly updates, and only notifications are sent only one time every x seconds.
2. Adding configuration of ESP modules:
	- Make a menu in which you can put your SSID, wifi password, and WAS-numbers of the two ESP modules.
	- Have phone send SSID, password to modules.
		-> connect to network with WAS-number as name
		-> send credentials
	- Have the ESP module save credentials.
3. Add settings menu:
	- have field for:
		- tolerance
		- target temperature
		- notification interval
	- save settings object to phone (in json file).
